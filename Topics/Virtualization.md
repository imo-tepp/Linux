# Virutalization

Virtualization is technology that you use to create a virtual representations of servers, storage, networks and other physical machines. It mimics the functions of physical hardware to run multiple virtual machines simultaneously on a single physical machine.

There are several software that can be used for virtualisation:
- *VMware* can partition a single physical server into multple virtual servers. It works with Linux and can be used concurrently on the same hardware.
- *Virtual Box* is a free virtualization software that can be used to run virtual machines with different operating system on your computer.
- *QEMU* is an emulator and a virutalization program that can run programs and operating system for a specific CPU on a different machine.
- *Citrix XenServer* and *Parallels Virtuozzo Containers* are other examples of software that delivers similar experience as the ones mentioned above.

## Advantages of Virtualization
- Cost-effective: By hosting several virtual machine on a single hardware, it effectively reduce the need to purchase more hardware for computing resources.
- Better utlilzation of resources: can utlilise all the available computing resource on the hardware by virutalising it.
- Reduced Management: can manage all the virutal server through the user of a single central dashboard.
- Flexible - virtualization can run different operating system and software on the same physical machine.

## Points to Remember
- Hardware is the solution for full virtualizaion 
- VMware ESXi is an example of server operating system.
- XML standard describes the interface of web services. 
- Abstraction (simplification) enables the key benefit of cloud computing , simplified, shared and ubqiuitous access.
- Virtualization assigns a logical name for a physical resource and then provides a pointer to that physical resource when a request is made
- Several important cloud computing approaches use a strictly hardware-based approach to abstraction.
- Most data center environments experience changes to performance requirements and workload activity over time.
- All of these methods proivde users with the ability to service their own requests with minimal IT oversight
